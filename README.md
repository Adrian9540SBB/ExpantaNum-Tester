# ExpantaNum-Tester
A basic HTML document that tests the ExpantaNum.js file where you can find [here](https://github.com/Naruyoko/ExpantaNum.js)


# The Basics

Adder = Adds numbers

Multiplier = Multiplies numbers

Exponent = the number to the power of the exponent (these first three are pretty straightforward)

Tetration = The current number tetrated by this number (Tetration is represented by double arrows e.g. 10^^8. a^^b = a^a^...^a^a with b a's)

Pentation = The current number pentated by this number (Pentation is represented by triple arrows e.g. 10^^^8. a^^^b = a^^a^^...^^a^^a with b a's)

Hexation = The current number hexated by this number (Hexation is represented by 4 arrows e.g. 10^^^^8. a^^^^b = a^^^a^^^...^^^a^^^a with b a's)


# Notations

Word Notation: The number name. It might be written as 7.56 quadrillion (which equals 7,560,000,000,000). I only coded in numbers up to 10^33003 for three reasons: I was lazy, I was confusing myself with my own code, and I don't know how to write numbers that extreme and everything in between.

Scientific Notation: Likely the most well-known one that's not standard, scientific notation is usually represented as a * 10^c or aE+c (where E represents 10^)

Standard Notation: The one you see on your math tests. Exponents are written as a<sup>b<sup>c</sup></sup> and so on and other numbers are written in a basic way, such as 123456.78.


# Other Features

Pause/Resume: Pauses/resumes the repeated operations.

Reset: Clears save data and reloads the page.

Save Checkbox: Toggles whether to save the number.

Digit Count: The number of digits after the decimal to write, ranges from 0 to 10.


# Known Bugs

Reset Button sometimes doesn't work

Sometimes it writes the number with one extra digit than it should
